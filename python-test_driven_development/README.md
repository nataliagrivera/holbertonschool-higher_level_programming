# Python - Test-driven development

This project focuses on test-driven development in Python. You will create a set of Python functions that adhere to specific requirements, including comprehensive documentation and tests for each function. Test-driven development (TDD) emphasizes writing tests before implementing code, ensuring code correctness and robustness. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of Python programming, the importance of testing, and how to write effective documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the strengths of Python programming.
- Create interactive tests and recognize their significance in the development process.
- Write detailed docstrings to establish testing criteria.
- Compose documentation for modules and functions to enhance code clarity.
- Identify essential option flags for creating tests.
- Recognize and handle edge cases efficiently.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- You should use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your code editors.
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- Ensure all your code files end with a newline.
- The first line of every code file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the project root is mandatory.
- Your code should comply with the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) style guide.
- All code files must be executable.
- The length of your code files will be checked using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases

- You should use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your code editors for test files.
- All test files should end with a newline.
- Test files must be placed in a folder called `tests`.
- Test files should have the `.txt` extension.
- To execute tests, use the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- Each module should have documentation (execute with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- Functions should also have documentation (execute with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`).
- Documentation should be descriptive, providing insights into the module, class, or method's purpose.

## Project Tasks

1. **Integers Addition (Task 0):** Write a function that adds two integers.
2. **Divide a Matrix (Task 1):** Write a function to divide all elements of a matrix.
3. **Say My Name (Task 2):** Create a function to print a name.
4. **Print Square (Task 3):** Develop a function to print a square of '#' characters.
5. **Text Indentation (Task 4):** Implement a function to format text with newline characters.
6. **Max Integer - Unittest (Task 5):** Write unit tests for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list.

**Note:** Each task has specific requirements, and the details of the implementation are found in the corresponding task descriptions.

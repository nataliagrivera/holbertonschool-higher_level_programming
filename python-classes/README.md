# Project Badge: Python - Classes and Objects

## Author: Guillaume
## Project Weight: 1

Welcome to the Python - Classes and Objects project by Guillaume!

## Background Context

In this project, you will dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It's important to not just read but also practice and experiment with OOP concepts. Make sure you understand the materials provided and try out the examples.

### Resources

Before you start, make sure to read and watch the following resources in order:

- **Object Oriented Programming**: Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded. You don't need to learn about class attributes, class methods, and static methods yet.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Please be careful; the author demonstrates how not to use or write a class to help you better understand concepts in Python 3. Read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You don't have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding," "Public, Protected, and Private Attributes."

- **Properties vs. Getters and Setters**

- **Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming**

- **Python Classes and Objects**

- **Object Oriented Programming**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following without relying on Google:

- What is OOP and the concept of "first-class everything."
- Understanding what a class is and the distinction between a class and an object or instance.
- Recognizing what attributes are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes.
- Understanding the purpose of "self" in Python.
- Comprehending the role of methods in classes.
- Using the special `__init__` method and its purpose.
- Grasping the concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- Understanding what a property is and the difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
- Writing getters and setters in a Pythonic way.
- Dynamically creating new attributes for existing class instances.
- Binding attributes to objects and classes.
- Exploring the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what it contains.
- Knowing how Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
- Utilizing the `getattr` function.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`).
- Documentation is not just a word; it's a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

## Let's Get Started!

You're now ready to dive into the world of Python Object-Oriented Programming. Read the resources, practice, and have fun exploring the world of classes and objects in Python!

Your progress will be updated as you complete the project tasks.

Happy coding!
